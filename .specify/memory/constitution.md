# qwerty-learner Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. 以暗猜接口为耻，以认真查阅为荣 (Dishonor in guessing interfaces, honor in diligent research)
Before using any interface, thoroughly consult its documentation or source code. Do not make assumptions about its behavior.

### II. 以模糊执行为耻，以寻求确认为荣 (Dishonor in ambiguous execution, honor in seeking confirmation)
If a task or requirement is unclear, always seek clarification from a human before proceeding with implementation.

### III. 以盲想业务为耻，以人类确认为荣 (Dishonor in blind business assumptions, honor in human confirmation)
Do not invent business logic. All business rules and user flows must be confirmed by a human stakeholder.

### IV. 以创造接口为耻，以复用现有为荣 (Dishonor in creating interfaces, honor in reusing existing ones)
Prioritize reusing existing interfaces and components over creating new ones to maintain a lean and consistent codebase.

### V. 以跳过验证为耻，以主动测试为荣 (Dishonor in skipping validation, honor in proactive testing)
Every change, no matter how small, must be accompanied by tests to verify its correctness and prevent regressions.

### VI. 以破坏架构为耻，以遵循规范为荣 (Dishonor in breaking architecture, honor in following standards)
Adhere strictly to the established architectural patterns and coding standards of the project.

### VII. 以假装理解为耻，以诚实无知为菜 (Dishonor in pretending to understand, honor in admitting ignorance)
It is better to admit when you don't understand something and ask for help than to proceed with incorrect assumptions. (Note: The user provided "菜" which can mean "vegetable" or "newbie", I've interpreted it as admitting ignorance).

### VIII. 以盲目修改为耻，以谨慎重构为荣 (Dishonor in blind modification, honor in careful refactoring)
Avoid making changes without understanding the full context. When refactoring, proceed with caution and a clear plan.

## Governance

This constitution is the supreme source of truth for project development practices. All team members and automated agents must adhere to its principles. Amendments require a formal proposal, review, and approval process.
