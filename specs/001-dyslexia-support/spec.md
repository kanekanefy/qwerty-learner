## Clarifications
### Session 2025-09-24
- Q: For the "visual cues" for each letter (FR-005), what is the desired implementation? ‚Üí A: Change the color and size of the letter as it's typed.
- Q: What type of "game-like elements" should be prioritized for FR-007? ‚Üí A: A progress bar with milestone rewards.
- Q: How should parents/teachers access the dashboard mentioned in FR-008? ‚Üí A: It should be part of the main application, accessible via a settings menu.
- Q: Will the text-to-speech feature (FR-006) use an external service or a built-in browser API? ‚Üí A: Provide both options and let the user choose.
- Q: How should the system "flag" words with irregular pronunciation? ‚Üí A: Display a small icon next to the word.

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A child with dyslexia who struggles with reading and spelling English words can use the application to learn new words in a way that is adapted to their specific needs. They can see words in a clear, easy-to-read format, hear them pronounced in different ways, and interact with them through multi-sensory activities, which helps them build confidence and improve their skills.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a child is presented with a new word, **When** they view the word, **Then** it is displayed in a large, clear, dyslexia-friendly font with extra spacing.
2. **Given** a child is learning a word with confusable letters (like 'b' and 'd'), **When** the word is displayed, **Then** the confusable letters are highlighted in different colors.
3. **Given** a child clicks on a word, **When** they hear the word, **Then** it is first read letter-by-letter, then as a whole word, and then the meaning is provided.
4. **Given** a child is practicing spelling, **When** they make a mistake, **Then** they receive gentle, encouraging feedback without harsh "error" messages.
5. **Given** a parent or teacher wants to review progress, **When** they access the support system, **Then** they can see a visual report of the child's progress and get suggestions for offline activities.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if a word is very long? The system should break it down by syllables.
- How does the system handle words with irregular pronunciation? These should be flagged with a small icon next to the word.
- What if a child is using a device with a small screen? The interface should adapt to ensure readability.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a setting to enable a dyslexia-friendly mode.
- **FR-002**: In dyslexia-friendly mode, all text MUST be rendered using a dyslexia-friendly font (e.g., OpenDyslexic).
- **FR-003**: The system MUST allow for adjusting font size, letter spacing, and color contrast.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST highlight and differentiate visually similar letters (e.g., b/d, p/q).
- **FR-005**: The system MUST provide multi-sensory feedback for typing, including unique sounds and visual cues (changing color and size) for each letter.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST offer a "read aloud" feature that breaks down words into phonemes and syllables, and allow the user to choose between a high-quality external text-to-speech service and the browser's built-in API.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST include a progress bar with milestone rewards to keep children motivated.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST provide a parent/teacher dashboard with progress reports and printable resources, accessible via a settings menu.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST dynamically adjust the difficulty based on the child's performance.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST offer different learning paths tailored to visual, auditory, or kinesthetic learners.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **User**: A child learning to read, or a parent/teacher.
- **Word**: An English word, including its spelling, pronunciation (phonemes), and meaning.
- **LearningProfile**: A user-specific profile that stores their progress, error patterns, and preferred learning style.
- **ProgressReport**: A summary of a user's learning activities and achievements over a period of time.
