# Quickstart: Dyslexia Support Features

This document outlines the steps to test the new dyslexia support features.

## Steps

1.  **Enable Dyslexia Mode:** Go to the settings page and enable the dyslexia-friendly mode.
2.  **Practice with Dyslexia-Friendly Font:** Go to the typing practice page and verify that the words are displayed in a dyslexia-friendly font with increased spacing.
3.  **Test Confusable Letter Highlighting:** Practice with words that contain confusable letters (e.g., 'b' and 'd') and verify that they are highlighted in different colors.
4.  **Test Read Aloud Feature:** Click on a word and verify that it is read aloud correctly. Test both the browser's built-in API and an external service if available.
5.  **Test Gentle Error Feedback:** Make a mistake while typing and verify that the error feedback is gentle and encouraging.
6.  **View Progress Report:** Go to the parent/teacher dashboard and verify that the progress report is displayed correctly.
7.  **Test Irregular Word Flagging:** Find a word with an irregular pronunciation and verify that it is flagged with an icon.
8.  **Test Read out typed letters:** Enable the feature and verify that the letters are read out as they are typed.
