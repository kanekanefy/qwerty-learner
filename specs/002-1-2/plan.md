# Implementation Plan: Analyze Existing Project and Plan Future Work

**Branch**: `002-1-2` | **Date**: 2025-09-24 | **Spec**: [link to spec.md]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-1-2/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan outlines the steps to analyze the existing `qwerty-learner` project and produce a high-level development plan for future work. The analysis will cover the entire codebase to identify existing features, areas for improvement, and potential conflicts.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript
**Primary Dependencies**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Playwright, Dexie.js, Jotai, Tauri
**Storage**: Dexie.js (IndexedDB)
**Testing**: Playwright (e2e)
**Target Platform**: Web, Desktop (via Tauri)
**Project Type**: Single project (React frontend) with a Tauri desktop wrapper.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Diligent Research:** The plan emphasizes analyzing the existing codebase before making changes.
- **II. Seek Confirmation:** The plan is to analyze and then present a plan, which will require human confirmation.
- **III. Human Confirmation:** The development plan will be presented for human confirmation.
- **IV. Reuse Existing:** The plan is to leverage existing work.
- **V. Proactive Testing:** The analysis will inform future testing strategies.
- **VI. Follow Standards:** The analysis will identify existing architectural patterns to be followed.
- **VII. Admit Ignorance:** The analysis is an admission that I need to learn about the project.
- **VIII. Careful Refactoring:** The plan will propose refactoring based on careful analysis.

**Result:** The plan is in compliance with all constitutional principles.

## Project Structure

### Documentation (this feature)
```
specs/002-1-2/
├── plan.md              # This file (/plan command output)
├── research.md          # Phase 0 output (/plan command)
├── data-model.md        # Phase 1 output (/plan command)
├── quickstart.md        # Phase 1 output (/plan command)
└── tasks.md             # Phase 2 output (/tasks command - NOT created by /plan)
```

### Source Code (repository root)

The project follows a standard single-page application structure with an additional `src-tauri` directory for the desktop application.

**Structure Decision**: Option 1: Single project

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1.  **Extract unknowns from Technical Context**: The main unknown is the specific implementation details of the existing features.
2.  **Generate and dispatch research agents**: I have already performed the initial research by listing all the files in the project.
3.  **Consolidate findings**: The findings are consolidated in `research.md`.

**Output**: `research.md` with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1.  **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`: The key entities have been documented in `data-model.md`.
2.  **Generate API contracts**: Not applicable for this feature.
3.  **Generate contract tests**: Not applicable for this feature.
4.  **Extract test scenarios**: The `quickstart.md` file contains the steps to perform the analysis.

**Output**: `data-model.md`, `quickstart.md`.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base.
- Generate tasks based on the steps outlined in `quickstart.md`.
- The tasks will involve reading and analyzing different parts of the codebase.
- The final task will be to generate the analysis report.

**Estimated Output**: 5-10 numbered, ordered tasks in `tasks.md`.
