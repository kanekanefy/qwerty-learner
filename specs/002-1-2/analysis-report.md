# Project Analysis Report

This report summarizes the findings from the analysis of the `qwerty-learner` project.

## 1. Project Overview

The project is a web-based typing tutor application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It also includes a Tauri-based desktop application. The application is designed to help users learn and practice typing, with a focus on English words.

## 2. Key Technologies

- **Frontend Framework:** React
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Database:** Dexie.js (a wrapper for IndexedDB)
- **Testing:** Playwright for end-to-end testing
- **Desktop App:** Tauri

## 3. Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the main source code for the React application.
- `src-tauri/`: Contains the source code for the Tauri desktop application.
- `public/`: Static assets, including a large collection of dictionaries.
- `tests/e2e/`: End-to-end tests.

## 4. Completed Features

Based on the analysis of the `src/pages` directory, the following features are considered complete:

- **Typing Practice:** The core feature of the application.
- **Analysis:** A page to analyze typing performance.
- **Error Book:** A place to review words that the user has typed incorrectly.
- **Dictionary Gallery:** A gallery of different dictionaries that the user can choose from.
- **Mobile View:** A mobile-specific view of the application.

## 5. Features to be Implemented

The user has requested a new feature to support users with dyslexia. This feature is specified in `/specs/001-dyslexia-support/spec.md`.

## 6. Areas for Improvement

- **Testing:** The project currently only has end-to-end tests. Adding unit and integration tests would improve the robustness of the codebase.
- **State Management:** The project uses Jotai for state management. While this is a good choice, a more structured approach to state management could be beneficial as the application grows.
- **Code Duplication:** There may be opportunities to reduce code duplication, particularly in the UI components.

## 7. High-Level Development Plan

1.  **Implement Dyslexia Support Feature:** Implement the features outlined in the dyslexia support specification.
2.  **Improve Test Coverage:** Add unit and integration tests for new and existing features.
3.  **Refactor State Management:** Refactor the state management to use a more structured approach.
4.  **UI/UX Improvements:** Continuously improve the user interface and user experience.
