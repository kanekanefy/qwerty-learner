# Feature Specification: Analyze Existing Project and Plan Future Work

**Feature Branch**: `002-1-2`
**Created**: 2025-09-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "This project has undergone some development before, and some functions have been completed. You need to carefully confirm: 1. Which functions have been done 2. Which ones still need you to do. Please make good use of the results of the previous project. If you think there are bad places, you can modify them, but be careful not to create conflicts. If there is a better solution technically, you can mention it, and then you can refactor or re-develop it. But you must figure out what has been changed before."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-09-24
- Q: What is the desired output format for the analysis? ‚Üí A: A Markdown report in the `specs` directory.
- Q: Should the analysis prioritize any specific parts of the codebase? ‚Üí A: No, analyze the entire codebase equally.
- Q: How should the analysis handle undocumented features? ‚Üí A: Add a section to the main analysis report for undocumented features.
- Q: Are there any performance requirements for the analysis? ‚Üí A: No, there are no performance requirements.
- Q: What level of detail is expected in the development plan? ‚Üí A: A high-level overview of the proposed features and changes.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer taking over an existing project, I need to understand the current state of the codebase, including what features are complete, what is in progress, and what areas could be improved, so that I can effectively plan and execute future development without introducing conflicts.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the existing codebase, **When** I analyze the project, **Then** I can produce a list of completed features.
2. **Given** the existing codebase, **When** I analyze the project, **Then** I can identify a list of features that need to be implemented.
3. **Given** the existing codebase, **When** I analyze the project, **Then** I can identify areas for potential refactoring or improvement.
4. **Given** the analysis, **When** I propose a development plan, **Then** the plan should leverage existing work and avoid conflicts.

### Edge Cases
- How to handle undocumented features? They should be documented in a dedicated section of the main analysis report.
- How to handle partially completed features? They should be assessed for completion or refactoring.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system (the agent) MUST analyze the entire codebase to identify existing functionality.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST categorize features into "complete", "in-progress", and "to-be-implemented".
- **FR-003**: The system MUST identify code that is of poor quality, and suggest improvements or refactoring.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST propose a high-level plan for future development that integrates with the existing codebase.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST ensure that any proposed changes do not conflict with existing, functional parts of the application.
- **FR-006**: The analysis output MUST be a Markdown report generated in the `specs` directory.
- **FR-007**: The analysis MUST cover the entire codebase without prioritizing any specific part.
- **FR-008**: The development plan MUST be a high-level overview of proposed features and changes.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: There are no performance requirements for the analysis.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Feature**: A distinct unit of functionality in the application.
- **Codebase**: The entire set of source code files for the project.
- **Development Plan**: A document outlining the strategy for future work.
