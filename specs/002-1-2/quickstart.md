# Quickstart: Project Analysis

This document outlines the steps to perform the analysis of the existing project.

## Steps

1.  **List all files:** Use the `glob` tool to list all files in the project.
2.  **Analyze `package.json`:** Read the `package.json` file to understand the project's dependencies and scripts.
3.  **Analyze `vite.config.ts`:** Read the `vite.config.ts` file to understand the project's build configuration.
4.  **Analyze `src` directory:** Analyze the `src` directory to understand the project's structure and identify existing features.
5.  **Analyze `src-tauri` directory:** Analyze the `src-tauri` directory to understand the desktop application's functionality.
6.  **Generate Analysis Report:** Based on the analysis, generate a Markdown report that includes:
    - A list of completed features.
    - A list of features that need to be implemented.
    - A list of areas for potential refactoring or improvement.
    - A high-level development plan.
