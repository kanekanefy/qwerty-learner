# Tasks: Analyze Existing Project and Plan Future Work

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-1-2/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 3.1: Analysis
- [X] T001 [P] Analyze `/Users/kane/Desktop/project/qwerty-learner/package.json` to understand project dependencies and scripts.
- [X] T002 [P] Analyze `/Users/kane/Desktop/project/qwerty-learner/vite.config.ts` to understand the project's build configuration.
- [X] T003 [P] Analyze the `/Users/kane/Desktop/project/qwerty-learner/src` directory to understand the project's structure and identify existing features.
- [X] T004 [P] Analyze the `/Users/kane/Desktop/project/qwerty-learner/src-tauri` directory to understand the desktop application's functionality.
- [X] T005 [P] Analyze the `/Users/kane/Desktop/project/qwerty-learner/tests/e2e` directory to understand the existing test coverage.

## Phase 3.2: Reporting
- [X] T006 Generate a Markdown report in `/Users/kane/Desktop/project/qwerty-learner/specs/002-1-2/analysis-report.md` that summarizes the findings from the analysis. The report should include a list of completed features, features to be implemented, and areas for improvement.
- [X] T007 Propose a high-level development plan in the analysis report based on the findings.

## Dependencies
- T001, T002, T003, T004, T005 must be completed before T006.
- T006 must be completed before T007.

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch T001-T005 together:
Task: "Analyze /Users/kane/Desktop/project/qwerty-learner/package.json to understand project dependencies and scripts."
Task: "Analyze /Users/kane/Desktop/project/qwerty-learner/vite.config.ts to understand the project's build configuration."
Task: "Analyze the /Users/kane/Desktop/project/qwerty-learner/src directory to understand the project's structure and identify existing features."
Task: "Analyze the /Users/kane/Desktop/project/qwerty-learner/src-tauri directory to understand the desktop application's functionality."
Task: "Analyze the /Users/kane/Desktop/project/qwerty-learner/tests/e2e directory to understand the existing test coverage."
```
